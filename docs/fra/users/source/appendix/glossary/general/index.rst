        as spreadsheets or flat files. The JDBC API provides a call-level API for
        SQL-based database access.
        JDBC technology allows you to use the Java programming language to exploit
        "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capabilities for applications that require access
        to enterprise data. With a JDBC technology-enabled driver, you can connect
        all corporate data even in a heterogeneous environment.
