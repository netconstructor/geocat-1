- improve french translation (merge from geocat.ch and GeoSource, Thanks Annina 
  and Etienne)
- improve CSW dc mapping response for service metadata in ISO or ISO profil
- harvesting / OGC-WxS harvester set coupledResource elements and not only 
  operatesOn.

  alert, sorting list). 
- admin / make common templates for metadata import and batch import forms.
- admin / if no templates available, display message rather than an empty list.
- admin, search / if no categories, hide option and set default option to none 
  (to be continued). Some users are not using categories at all.
- add some FIXME to be discussed for cleaning. Mainly in XSL templates and 
  localised stuff in JS. In JS, it could be better to create an array of 
  localised string needed in JS files. This could allow to make a better 
  separation with JS and XSL files (ie. remove all JS from XSL files) and call 
  this array to retrieve localised string from JS.
- edit / edit buttons : localisation and truncate title if larger than XX
  character.
- Do not capitalize all element name to avoid Point Of Contact. Fixe capitalize 
  in localisation files if needed.

  select box)

=== GeoNetwork beta 2 : List of changes
===
================================================================================

- Added a form to remove old, empty metadata
  An empty metadata has been defined as follow:
   - it is not a template
	 - it is local (its source == to the geonetwork site id)
	 - the difference between the last change date and the creation date (in
	   minutes) is less than a given difference
	 - it has no operations associated to the internet group

- Added a button to create a metadata from a template
  Added a form (in administration) to create a metadata from a template
  
- Added an UUID to metadata when creating it from a template, from the xml
  import or from the batch import forms.

- Improved ISO editor stylesheet

- Added upload features to the ISO editor

- Added a popup to place a keyword in ISO19115 editor

- Added a popup to place a bounding box in ISO19115 editor

=== Changes
================================================================================

  - Table Metadata: added "uuid"
	- Table Groups  : added "description", "email", "referrer"

- Fixed some initial data in the installer

  main page and metadata with thumbnails on the search results.

- The harvesting procedure now stores the uuid got from the remote site

- Creation of a new metadata ('create' button, xml insert/import): 
  - privileges belonging to the 'internet' group are removed. This is related
	  to the 'search for empty/unused metadata' functionality.
	- privileges belonging to the 'intranet' group are removed.
	- the group that is adding the metadata has all privileges on it
	- privileges associated to other groups are copied from the DefaultOper table

  improved diagnostic message

  browser
